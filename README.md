Interaction programming - Project

Dui Ardal, Gustav Frisk Arfvidsson, Patrik Odqvist and Sebastian Holmqvist.

Regarding the commit history:
We have been commiting for the later part of the project, when we understood how to use github properly.
We then tried to commit continuously and set up different branches to visualize how we commited our divided work.
However, in gusteve-patch, it says that duiardal has commited. This was an error because Gustav commited through duiardals git.
Furthermore, all the different commits has more or less been done in group, because we have been sitting together the entire team most of the time.
